A simple Unity3D project to add Jetpack-like flight to any
project or assets you might have lying around.

The purpose of this project is just to give you the start
of a way to fly over assets that you have in Unity3D.

You are welcome to turn it into a full-fledged game if
you like. In fact, I encourage it!
